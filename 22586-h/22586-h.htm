<p><span class="smcap">In</span> taking up the thread of Captain George A. Thayer's admirable
chapter upon the Chancellorsville campaign, we find the regiment
baling out their old log pens, on a dark night, in the rain.
They had stripped the canvas roofs before starting for Chancellorsville.
The return to a deserted camp, even in fine weather,
flushed with victory, is not agreeable. The failure of Chancellorsville
made the discomforts of this memorable night harder to
bear, and it seemed very much like some of the worst experiences
of the "Mud campaign."</p>

<p>Company "D" pursued their work with vigor, and sang with
the broadest sarcasm "Home Again." This had rather an enlivening
effect upon some of the other companies, who, up to this
time, had been very silent. Daylight relieved us all; and, with
sunshine and regimental "police," the place soon looked as if
nothing had happened, except for the late absentees, some of
whom would return when their wounds permitted; but others
would never again draw their swords under the old battle-flag.
The scholarly Fitzgerald, who died so bravely, was the only officer
of "ours" killed at Chancellorsville.</p>

<p>It was at this very camp, about a month before, that the gallant
and lamented Colonel Shaw, then a captain in our regiment, left
us to organize and command that fated battalion, the "Fifty-fourth
Colored Massachusetts." Here, we again formed a mess
with the officers of the Third Wisconsin; and our former caterer,
Charley Johnson, and his colored staff, managed the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>.
Those who were fortunate enough to be present will remember
the surprise party given to us by the officers of the Third Wisconsin
in our canvas dining-room, at the foot of the hill, and
how it burst upon us in all its splendor of bayonet chandeliers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Page 2]</a></span>
and unlimited "commissary." Brigade man&#339;uvres and battalion
drills were diligently practised; and, when Casey's tactics were
scarcely dry from the press, Colonel Sam Quincy, with the least
possible preparation on our part, "sprung" on us the new movement
of "Forward on the centre to form square" at "double-quick."
And, I am ashamed to say, that, practised as we were in
all the tricks of field man&#339;uvres, we "got mixed." The right
wing started without delay for Falmouth, the left wing for Acquia
Creek, and the color division took a steady trot for the camp of
the Tenth Maine. Adjutant Fox galloped wildly about the field,
the Colonel howled in despair, but on we went till the word
"Halt!" brought us to a stand, and we came back and formed
line. The Colonel then made the memorable remark, "Gentlemen
will please to have some connection of ideas," and started
the machine again at full speed. This time we melted into a
square in a manner which would have pleased General Andrews.
From this camp, Colonel Quincy resigned, pretty well exhausted
with wounds, exposure, and the trials of the Rebel prison.</p>

<p>We now moved camp&mdash;Major Mudge commanding&mdash;to a pine
grove, where we constructed quite a picturesque military village,
and became absorbed in the habits and peculiarities of the wood-tick.</p>

<p>The days rolled on into June; and it seemed fully time to be
doing something more about beating Lee, whose lieutenants were
successfully screening their preparations for the coming Northern
invasion. General Halleck, General-in-Chief at Washington, was
still busily engaged telegraphing to the generals in the field; and,
no doubt, Hooker was hampered by these voluminous instructions,
often so at variance with his own plans, which were apt to be
excellent, and he was unable at times to suppress his own dominant
and rather insubordinate spirit.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, Stuart was discovered concentrating his
troopers in great force at Culpepper. Mr. Stuart's "Critter-back
Company" was supposed to number about twelve thousand sabres,
and information obtained by General Buford showed that the
Rebels were preparing for a cavalry raid on a scale never before
attempted.</p>

<p>Here was an opportunity for the "Cavalry Corps" which
Hooker had organized; but, owing to the wear and tear of Stoneman's
raid, General Hooker thought our cavalry weak to cope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Page 3]</a></span>
with the enemy, if their numbers as reported were correct. He
decided, however, to send General Pleasanton with all the cavalry
to attack Stuart, "stiffened," as he expressed it, with about five
thousand infantry.</p>

<p>This "stiffening" consisted of a few selected regiments, including
"ours," to be divided equally between two columns of cavalry,&mdash;one
under Buford, with Ames to command his infantry, the other
under Gregg, with General David Russell as infantry commander.</p>

<p>The total force of infantry was probably not more than three
thousand, as each regiment was thinned down by weeding out
every man who could not be relied upon for a forced march.
The order came on the afternoon of June 6 to "get ready in
light marching order for a secret expedition, leaving all sick and
baggage behind." The news soon spread through camp, and
friends from other regiments came to witness the departure of the
chosen. Upon learning that the Third Wisconsin was not included
in the order, the enthusiasm in the Second Massachusetts
was considerably dampened. "The Third" was certain that
there must be some mistake in the transmission of the order.
These two regiments had been brigaded together since the beginning
of the war, and had fought side by side in every action.
There was a sense of mutual support, and a desire to share equally
all the honors; a strong feeling of pride in each regarding the
achievements of the other. To us, it would have been unnatural
to go into action without the Third Wisconsin, or at least not to
know that they were in support. A hasty consultation resulted in
sending an officer to present the case at head-quarters. The chaplain's
excellent mare was summarily pressed for the service; and
our ambassador, springing into the clerical saddle, shot away for
General Ruger's head-quarters. He returned with an encouraging
word that the General would see what could be done.</p>

<p>The column was already moving out of camp, under the gaze of
a crowd of officers and men. It seemed quite a family affair, as
we noticed the "Thirty-third Massachusetts" already on the road
waiting for us, under the fatherly protection of Colonel Underwood,
who had been so long a member of "ours" as captain of
"the bloody I's." Opinions were exchanged as to the probability
of the Third Wisconsin getting its orders. Bets, of course, were
freely offered and taken on the chances. Meantime, we were
joined by a battery of horse artillery and a string of pack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Page 4]</a></span>
mules carrying extra ammunition. Presently, a battalion appeared
coming over the hill at a pace indicating important business. Our
cheering was taken up by the rest of the column; and the Third
Wisconsin replied with wild howls, and quickly took their place as
part of our special brigade.</p>

<p>After a furious thunder-shower, which laid the dust, General
Ames gave the word; and the command moved off at a smart
gait. The air was cool, and every member of the chosen band
was in high spirits. Even that army-trodden country, under the
circumstances, and with the influence of a beautiful sunset,
looked fresh and picturesque.</p>

<p>There was evidently a strong impression that we were able-bodied
to the last man; for we skipped along for eight miles without
a halt, in a style which impressed our cavalry friends, whom
we found about eight o'clock in the evening drawn up in a field at
the roadside, to give us the right of way. A voice came from one
of the saddles, "I say, boys! what brigade?" "Ah, you recruit!"
replied one of the wits of the regiment: "don't you know this
brigade? This is Gordon's flying brigade,"&mdash;which was received
with much merriment. The men were in excellent humor, ready
to bandy words with any one, especially the cavalry, whom they
began to divine they were to operate with. This elegant repartee
was kept up all along the line. Occasionally, officers exchanged
greetings, where friends could make each other out in the dark.
A hasty word and shake of the hand (perhaps the last), and our
cavalry friend is left still watching the column as it marches
briskly along. Another cavalry detachment inquires: "What's
your hurry, boys? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"We're going to Richmond. Saddle up, you cowards, and come
along!" A soldier in the next company, of an inquiring disposition,
asks, "Who ever saw a dead cavalry man?"</p>

<p>We bivouacked near Spotted Tavern, about eleven o'clock at
night; and, after this lively march of sixteen miles, we were
allowed a comfortable rest, while the cavalry occupied the road.</p>

<p>Resuming our march at ten o'clock next day, we reached Bealton
about sunset, and were carefully concealed in the woods.
Lighting of fires was absolutely forbidden; and, as the night
closed in upon us, the staff remained in the saddle, stationed at
different points, silently watching us; and, as morning came again,
there they were still on the watch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Page 5]</a></span>Meantime, General Russell had marched his infantry to Hartwood
Church, and thence to a point near Kelly's Ford, where
General Gregg was concentrating two divisions of cavalry.</p>

<p>The night of the 8th, we moved down very near Beverly Ford
into the woods again,&mdash;cold suppers and no lights. The men
were exceedingly restless at these unusual orders about light and
noise. In a letter from one of my men since the war, he says:
"The men thought we were being humbugged, and there were
many signs of dissatisfaction. They complained because we were
not allowed to have fires. Dave Orne was punished (ordered to
stand at attention) by you, for snapping a cap upon his gun. It
was exceedingly galling to his soldierly pride, as it was the only
time he was punished during his term of service. Hyde was
particularly insubordinate; and you were placed in arrest, because
Company 'D' was so disorderly."</p>

<p>I remember this very well, and my servant standing at a respectful
distance, holding my sabre while I was under this temporary
cloud. The gallant commander of the "Irish Brigade," as
we called Company "H," shared the cloud with me; for he was
placed in arrest at the same time. Our sabres, however, were
returned to us before we got into the fight; and, in the evening
bivouac, our commander made us a most graceful apology over a
tin mug of "commissary."</p>

<p>Buford's whole column was now concealed in the woods. The
cheerful clank and jingle of the cavalry was, by some means,
suppressed; there was no merry bugle breaking upon the still
hours of the night; and, as the moon threw deep shadows across
the quiet country road, there seemed no trace of "grim-visaged
war."</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning, Captain Comey, with thirty
picked men from the Second Massachusetts, crept down to the
river-bank, to see that all was clear for the advance. He reported
a large force of cavalry in bivouac on the south side of the river,
quite unconscious of Buford's stealthy approach. Indeed, Jones'
Rebel cavalry brigade was only a short distance from the Ford,
while his wagons and artillery were parked even nearer to the
river. Fitz Hugh Lee, Robertson, and W. H. F. Lee were in
bivouac at various points within supporting distance of Jones;
while Wade Hampton was passing the night in picturesque reserve
at Fleetwood Hill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Page 6]</a></span>The spot was admirably adapted for a cavalry battle, the
country rolling along, with an occasional clump of woods and fine
open fields, toward Brandy Station, where the Rebel cavalry-chief,
Stuart, had pitched his head-quarters.</p>

<p>The close proximity of Stuart's troopers was a little unexpected.
Their movement to Beverly Ford, it seems, was simultaneous with
our own.</p>

<p>The plan was to have the enemy remain somewhere near Culpepper,
while Gregg's column advanced from Kelly's Ford, and
Buford's from Beverly Ford, the first bearing to the left, the latter
to the right, the two columns to form a junction near Brandy
Station. General Pleasanton then, having our entire force well
in hand, would make a determined attack upon Stuart's squadrons.
But it is the unexpected which must be looked for in war, and
the necessary tactics were quickly decided upon.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of Stuart's force was in our immediate front;
but they would be exposed to the disadvantage of a surprise, and,
having no infantry with them, our little brigade of rifles would be
doubly effective.</p>

<p>General Pleasanton would be unable to control and harmonize
the movements of his two columns, being completely cut off from
General Gregg; but the latter was so well known as an able commander
and a hard fighter that the enemy was certain to be treated
again to a surprise in flank and rear, and would be thus diverted
from our front. And it seemed as if we might still succeed in
breaking up the enemy's cavalry.</p>

<p>The situation had its advantages, in spite of the opinion of
some distinguished cavalry men; and "Forward!" was the word.</p>

<p>As the hazy June morning dawned upon us, troopers appeared
to rise out of the ground and swarm out of the woods, till the
whole country seemed alive with cavalry; and Ames' picked
rifles took their place in the column.</p>

<p>The early morning mist, hanging upon the river banks, concealed
our approach.</p>

<p class="poem">
"In both our armies, there is many a soul<br />
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,<br />
If once they join in trial."<br />
</p>

<p>The gallant and lamented Colonel Davis led the way with the
Eighth New York Cavalry, dashing over the Ford and surprising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Page 7]</a></span>
the enemy's pickets, who fell back upon Jones' exposed artillery
and wagons.</p>

<p>The Rebels were panic-stricken at the sudden approach of the
"Yankee" cavalry; and great confusion ensued. But the alarm
quickly spread, and part of Jones' troopers were soon in the
saddle, charging furiously down upon the Eighth New York, who
broke; and, before Colonel Davis could turn to rally his leading
regiment, a Rebel soldier sprang from behind a tree and shot him
dead. But the avenging sabre of Lieutenant Parsons (Davis'
adjutant) severed the poor fellow's connection with this life.</p>

<p>Colonel Davis was a serious loss to the "Cavalry Corps,"&mdash;a
graduate of West Point, an accomplished officer, a universal
favorite,&mdash;and, although a Southerner, he stuck to the flag he had
sworn to defend.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Eighth Illinois Cavalry had gained the southern
bank, and rushed upon Jones' people, driving them back upon
the main body, who were forming in the rear of a bit of wood.
Colonel Davis was borne back in a blanket as General Pleasanton,
who had accompanied our column in person, arrived at the river
bank.</p>

<p>The Third Indiana Cavalry followed the Eighth Illinois; and
Ames' men were now crossing under the eye of the distinguished
group of horsemen, to one of whom (Colonel F. C. Newhall,
afterward of Sheridan's staff) I am indebted for the following
description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote"><p>General Buford was there, with his usual smile. He rode a gray
horse, at a slow walk generally, and smoked a pipe, no matter what was
going on around him; and it was always reassuring to see him in the
saddle when there was any chance of a fight.</p>

<p>General Pleasanton's staff was partly composed of men who became
distinguished. The Adjutant General was A. J. Alexander, of Kentucky,
a very handsome fellow, who was afterward a Brigadier General
with Thomas, in the West. Among the aides was Captain Farnsworth,
Eighth Illinois Cavalry, who so distinguished himself in the coming
battle, and in the subsequent operations south of the Potomac, that he
was made a Brigadier General, and with that rank fell at Gettysburg,
at the head of a brigade of cavalry which he had commanded but a few
days. Another aide was the brilliant Custer, then a lieutenant, whose
career and lamented death there is no need to recall. Another was
Lieutenant R. S. McKenzie, of the engineers, now General McKenzie
of well-won fame, the youngest colonel of the regular army; and still
another was Ulric Dahlgren. General Pleasanton had certainly no lack
of intelligence, dash, and hard-riding to rely on in those about him.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The infantry had now cleared the woods of the enemy's
troopers, who were deceived as to the number of our rifles, and
showed no inclination to expose men and horses to the deadly
fire of experienced infantry skirmishers.</p>

<p>The old, time-honored Second Dragoons, the Fifth Regulars,
and that crack young regiment, the Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry
(forming what was known as the "Reserve Brigade"), were massing
on the southern bank of the river. The sharp report of infantry
rifles, the rising smoke, and the thousand indescribable
sounds, with the tramp of fresh cavalry pressing forward to take
their part in the fray, showed that the battle was now waging in
good earnest. The wounded arrived more rapidly at the ford,
stretcher-bearers plying their trade in the hot sun.</p>

<p>The soft, dewy grass of the morning was now kicked and
trampled into dry dust. The infantry held the enemy in the open
space beyond the woods; while Buford hurled his squadrons, with
drawn sabres, upon the Rebel cavalry on the right and left.</p>

<p>A sabre charge, with both sides going at top speed, is, perhaps,
the most exciting and picturesque combination of force, nerve,
and courage that can be imagined. The commanding officers
leading in conspicuous advance; the rush, the thunder of horses'
hoofs; the rattle of arms and equipments,&mdash;all mingling with the
roar of voices, while the space rapidly lessens between the approaching
squadrons. The commanders who were seen, a moment
before, splendidly mounted, dashing on at racing speed,
turning in the saddle to look back at the tidal wave which they
are leading, disappear in a cloud of sabres, clashing and cutting;
but the fight is partly obscured by the rising dust and the mist
from the over-heated animals. Riderless horses come, wounded
and trembling, out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e; others appear, running in fright,
carrying dying troopers still sitting their chargers, the head drooping
on the breast, the sword-arm hanging lifeless, the blood-stained
sabre dangling from the wrist, tossing, swinging, and cutting the
poor animal's flanks, goading him on in his aimless flight. In
this moment of intense excitement, the Rebels give way on the
left. Our troopers follow in hot pursuit. On they go, over the
dead and dying. At the sound of the "recall," back they come,
to take breath and re-form at the rallying ground to which Ames'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Page 9]</a></span>
skirmishers move forward, to regain their connection and establish
a more advanced line of battle. Although the infantry occupied
the centre of the line, their operations were not confined to this
point. They were sent in small detachments to different parts of
the field, to support artillery, and, at times, even to engage the
enemy, when opportunity offered. The line officers bore a
thorough test of their experience and training during a day of
perpetual activity.</p>

<p>The "Reserve Brigade" had gone into action. There were to
be no fresh troops in waiting. Every one was needed at the
front.</p>

<p>The Rebels made desperate attempts to capture the ford, and
pressed us hard on the right. This part of our line made little
progress, and was forced at times to assume simply the defensive.</p>

<p>Two squadrons of the Second Dragoons were withdrawn to
assist in covering the approaches to the ford.</p>

<p>The Rebels made another desperate charge. It seemed, this
time, as if they would carry all before them. But we stood our
ground, and opened on them at close quarters with the guns; and
Ames' men plied their rifles, making every bullet tell. The
enemy lost heavily, and came to a stand. The Dragoons dropped
their carbines, and, drawing sabres, rushed upon them, driving
them off in confusion.</p>

<p>It was hot work all along the line; and, although our cavalry
suffered severely at times, nothing could surpass their gallant
conduct.</p>

<p>The Sixth Pennsylvania, in charging the enemy near St. James'
Church, were badly punished by the Rebel artillery, and had to
withdraw with heavy loss of officers, men, and horses. Their
gallant commander, Major Morris, whose horse fell upon him,
was left a prisoner in the enemy's hands. The Second Dragoons
also suffered severely at this point.</p>

<p>Much to our relief, the enemy now appeared to be attacked in
the rear, as they made no further attempt to capture the ford, and
the force in our front was evidently reduced.</p>

<p>A Rebel battery now opened from a bit of woods about six
hundred yards in front, while we were making disposition to
advance our right, and our guns unlimbered upon a knoll in the
open fields in front and to the right of the ford; and a lively cannonade
ensued. I was skirmishing nearer to the centre of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Page 10]</a></span>
line with my own company and Company "F," the latter under
command of Captain, then Lieutenant, Parker, and was ordered
with these two companies to support the guns on the knoll. On
the way, I was joined by Colonel, then Captain, Stevenson of the
Third Wisconsin, who had been ordered to the same duty. General
Buford and some staff officers were standing near the guns,
their horses awaiting them in the rear, where the artillery horses
had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Part of the Tenth Virginia Cavalry were on foot behind a
stone wall down in the open fields in front; and they endeavored
to interfere with us as much as possible while we were
posting Lieutenant Parker with two men as a "lookout" to
apprise us of any movement on the part of the enemy. They had
already annoyed our artillery very much, popping at them with
their carbines.</p>

<p>Captain Stevenson and I lay down with our companies in the
usual position of artillery supports, about thirty yards in rear,
while our guns belched forth their fire and smoke, and the
enemy's shells came howling overhead and bursting behind us
with that spiteful, sharp, clean-cut bang which we used to know so
well.</p>

<p>Having nothing to do as yet but smoke our pipes, we lolled on
the grass and studied our cavalry friends. Custer was the most
striking figure in the group, with his fanciful uniform, his long
hair, and spirited manner. He seemed to enjoy the shelling, and
appeared to beam all over, almost dancing with excitement.</p>

<p>Other staff officers arrived from time to time, and, plunging into
the group, on their reeking horses, spoke to General Buford, and
then dashed away again. The fight seemed still going on in the
centre and on the left, which had advanced considerably; but our
view was somewhat obstructed by clumps of woods.</p>

<p>General Buford, whom we had never seen before, impressed us
with his commanding presence and his manly and picturesque
simplicity of dress. He looked as if his division might idolize
him, as it was said they did. He seemed much annoyed at the
Tenth Virginia Cavalry behind the wall, and at last summoned
the commander of the infantry supports. Although Stevenson
commanded, he wished me to assist at the audience; and we were
at the General's side in a moment, looking over the guns at the
surrounding country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Page 11]</a></span>"Do you see those people down there?" says Buford: "they've
got to be driven out. Do you think you can do it?"</p>

<p>We looked up and down the line, and rested our gaze upon a
wheat-field on the left of the stone wall (the enemy's right).</p>

<p>"It's about double our force," says Stevenson.</p>

<p>"Fully that," I replied, "if not more."</p>

<p>We looked again at the wheat-field, for that was the key to
the position. Something was said about "flanking" and "enfilading
'em."</p>

<p>"Mind," said the General, "I don't order you; but, if you think
you can do it, go in."</p>

<p>We thought we could. It would hardly do to back out in the
presence of so distinguished a cavalry audience, if there was a
chance of success. A number of the staff had gathered round
to hear our conversation, and showed a great deal of interest at
the prospect of a little "side show," at which they would have
orchestra chairs, front row.</p>

<p>The General, with this group around him, was drawing the fire
of the stone wall people, and was urged to keep out of range,
while the rest of us scattered to less dangerous positions. Some
of the staff came back and watched the men "fall in," as if to
see us off. Custer showed much interest, and evidently would
have enjoyed going with us.</p>

<p>We struck back into the country, and took a circuitous route
behind hedges and through corn-fields, Stevenson and myself running
on together, and the men following with their rifles as low as
possible, and crouching along to avoid attracting any notice.</p>

<p>We planned the attack as we went along, instructing sergeants,
who in turn fell back and gave orders to the men. Upon arriving
at the wheat-field, we all hugged the ground. Ten picked marksmen
now crawled forward with me into the wheat, while Captain
Stevenson deployed the rest of the men into as long a skirmish
line as their numbers would permit.</p>

<p>We despatched a messenger to notify Lieutenant Parker, whom
we had left near the guns, to join us at once. In justice to Parker,
I must say that he hated to be left out of a fight.</p>

<p>The ten marksmen crawled on through the wheat, till they were
almost "on the end" of the enemy's line; and then, crowding
together so as to rake the line, they fired at the signal, with terrible
accuracy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</a></span>The Rebels were completely surprised, but turned and delivered
a scattering fire. My excellent Sergeant Nutting fell into my
arms mortally wounded. He was all pluck to the last moment.
Although he could not speak, he showed signs of wishing to bid
us good-by, and was evidently gratified at the manner in which we
tenderly shook him by the hand. It was a success for the company,
but the men all seemed to share my own feeling that it was
dearly bought at such a price.</p>

<p>Meantime, Captain Stevenson was advancing through the wheat;
and, as soon as my party fired, he began making noise enough for
two regiments. We sprang over the fence into the open field;
and there we found Lieutenant Parker standing on the stone wall,
pistol in hand, with his two men and the messenger, demanding
"unconditional surrender."</p>

<p>We could not help being amused at Parker's sudden appearance;
but he explained that he was afraid that he would be too
late, and so "charged the stone wall in front, and took the
chances."</p>

<p>Stevenson's men were coming over the fence all the way down
the wheat; and the enemy, utterly deceived as to our numbers,
had already commenced dropping their weapons and giving themselves
up. We hurried them off as rapidly as possible, and gave
all the care we could to the wounded. Some of the Rebels at the
other end of the wall tried to escape; but Stevenson had swung
his line round so promptly that he covered them at short range,
and persuaded the runaways to come in. Having killed, wounded,
and captured the entire party, we retired to a rising ground to the
left of our own guns, and covered the approaches to the stone
wall by posting some sharp-shooters with their pieces sighted at
three hundred yards. At this distance, two of the enemy's dismounted
troopers were killed. This seemed to be sufficient warning
to the rest, who made no further attempt to occupy the stone
wall.</p>

<p>General Buford now advanced the right of the line, and pressed
forward, driving the enemy's cavalry before him toward Fleetwood
Hill. General Gregg, who had relieved us at such a critical
moment by diverting the enemy from our front, had crossed
Kelly's Ford at daylight with little opposition, and left General
Russell with his infantry to guard the lower fords.</p>

<p>Colonel Duffie's division was sent to Stevensburg, where they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</a></span>
encountered the enemy, and drove them through and beyond the
town, with our friends of the First Massachusetts Cavalry in the
advance; and here Colonel Duffie remained, according to the
original plan.</p>

<p>General Gregg pushed on toward Brandy Station with Kilpatrick's
and Windham's brigades. The latter attacked the Rebel
cavalry so promptly that they were scarcely ready for him.
Stuart's head-quarters were captured and important despatches
fell into our hands, with valuable information as to the enemy's
plans. Windham and Kilpatrick were both hotly engaged as
troops were withdrawn from Buford's front to resist them.</p>

<p>Gregg's people fought hard, charging repeatedly with the sabre,
and gradually gaining the crest of Fleetwood Hill. The Sixth
New York Light Battery did their full share of work.</p>

<p>More troops were withdrawn from Buford's front; and, at last,
General Gregg, finding himself overmatched, withdrew to the foot
of the hill, leaving two guns in the enemy's hands. Colonel H. S.
Thomas describes the cannoneers reluctantly obeying the order to
leave the guns, some of the men actually shedding tears.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, General Buford continued to push the enemy toward
Fleetwood, and again the Rebels began to resist us more stubbornly.
Both sides charged repeatedly with the sabre, and at
times dismounted to fight behind stone walls, Ames' rifles making
themselves generally useful at various points in the field.</p>

<p>In one very spirited charge of the Second Dragoons, General
Merritt, then a captain, rode impetuously on, not hearing the
recall, followed by Lieutenant Quirk. He noticed a prominent
Rebel officer, and, riding toward him, bringing his sabre to a
point, he innocently remarked, "Colonel, you are my prisoner!"
The officer made a cut at his head: Merritt, dexterously parrying
the cut, only lost his hat. His opponent turned out to be Colonel,
afterward, General Wade Hampton. Lieutenant Quirk called out
to Merritt, "We're surrounded!" and, sure enough, a Rebel ring
had formed to see the "Yankee" officer brought down. But
Merritt and Quirk had not been taught to ride for nothing, and
galloped safely back into our lines, amid a shower of pistol
bullets.</p>

<p>General Rodenbough, then a captain, and many others of the
cavalry, had personal encounters, in which they proved themselves
to be excellent swordsmen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</a></span>As our two columns drew nearer together, both aiming for
Fleetwood Hill, the junction was at last accomplished; and
General Gregg rode into our lines, reporting a heavy force of
Rebel infantry pouring into Brandy Station from Culpepper by
rail.</p>

<p>General Pleasanton not caring to encounter the Rebel infantry,
especially after a day of such hard pounding, ordered General
Gregg to withdraw by way of Rappahannock Station; and Colonel
Newhall was sent to tell Buford to stop fighting, and go home by
way of Beverly Ford.</p>

<p>The operation of withdrawal was accomplished without interference,
the enemy contenting themselves with looking on from a
respectful distance. As we approached Beverly Ford, the First
Regular Cavalry turned up, eager for the fray. They had been off
on some detached duty and were too late for any of the fun, so
General Pleasanton had them all deployed as mounted skirmishers
to cover the crossing of the troops.</p>

<p>The scene at the ford was very picturesque. A lovely sunset
shed its cool light over the long columns of cavalry winding their
way toward the river, and the mounted skirmishers were thrown in
bold relief against the brilliant sky.</p>

<p>Captain Comey took his old position again, with his little band
of thirty men, on the north bank of the river, and remained there
till morning, when he rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p>Our bivouac the night of the battle was unusually cheerful, for
we had brought every officer of "ours" safely out of the fight
alive and well. Even Captain Frank Crowninshield, who generally
got a bullet into him somewhere, came off, like the Irishman
at the fair, with only a hole in the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>Many a fence rail was burned to give light to the conference
which was held over the events of the day. We had been so
separated during the fight that the experiences of each one had to
be presented to the assemblage in turn; and, with the assistance of
some of the Third Wisconsin officers, the comparing of notes was
extended far into the night.</p>

<p>Our forces had gained all they set out to accomplish. The
momentous cavalry schemes of the enemy were frustrated, and
their troopers had been severely punished by cavalry which they
had always considered inferior to their own.</p>

<p>The disheartening effect throughout the Confederacy may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</a></span>
guessed by the following extract from a diary kept by Mr. I. D.
Jones, the Rebel War Clerk at Richmond:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote"><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;The surprise of Stuart on the Rappahannock has chilled
every heart, notwithstanding it does not appear that we lost more than
the enemy in the encounter. The question is on every tongue, Have our
generals relaxed in vigilance? If so, sad is the prospect.</p>

<p>After the long period of mismanagement, disaster, sacrifice,
blood, and tears through which the Army of the Potomac had
passed, with steadiness of purpose and undaunted courage which
has never been surpassed, the turning-point came, at last, in the
brilliant conflict at Beverly Ford, or "Fleetwood," as the Rebel
chief, Stuart, called it.</p>

<p>It was a severe blow to the enemy's cavalry at the right moment,
and was productive of important results, being followed by
Pleasanton in the battles of Aldie, Middleburg, and Upperville,
holding Stuart in check and keeping Hooker fully informed as to
the movements of the enemy; while General Lee was in constant
anxiety and in want of information during his march up the
Cumberland Valley and, in fact, during the whole of the Gettysburg
campaign. On the 27th of June, General Hooker requested
to be relieved, and General Mead assumed command of the Army
of the Potomac.</p>

<p>This change of commanders was accomplished while the two
great armies were in motion. There was no excitement over it.
The Army of the Potomac was not very sorry to part with General
Hooker, nor specially pleased to be commanded by Mead. On
the whole, they had more confidence in the latter; but the main
object was to beat Lee.</p>
